    Vespa ist a modern full text search database. Hybrid text search is combining traditional
    keyword matching with a semantic vector search. And may lead to improved search results
    in comparison to BM25 alone.

    The following rules apply:
    <ul>
        <li>Search is case-insensitive.</li>
        <li>All terms in the query must be matched by a document (implicit AND query).</li>
        <li>term1 OR term2 (capital OR) means that either term1 or term2 must match.</li>
        <li>Terms surrounded by quotes are search as exact phrase, e.g. "lung disease".</li>
        <li>+ in front of a term means that the exact term must match.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
