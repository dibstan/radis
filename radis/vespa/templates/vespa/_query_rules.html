The following rules apply:
<ul>
    <li>Search is case-insensitive.</li>
    <li>All terms in the query must be matched by a document (implicit AND query).</li>
    <li>term1 OR term2 (capital OR) means that either term1 or term2 must match.</li>
    <li>Terms surrounded by quotes are search as exact phrase, e.g. "lung disease".</li>
    <li>+ in front of a term means that the exact term must match.</li>
</ul>
