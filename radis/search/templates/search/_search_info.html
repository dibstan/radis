            Provide your search query in the search box above to search for reports. You can use
            additional filters to narrow down the search results (on the right side).

            The following search rules apply:
            <ul>
                <li>Search terms are case-insensitive.</li>
                <li>All terms in a query must be matched by a document (implicit AND query).</li>
                <li>term1 OR term2 (capital OR) means that either term1 or term2 must match.</li>
                <li>A phrase surrounded by quotes will look for an exact match, e.g. "lung disease".</li>
                <li>- in front of a term means that the term or phrase must not be present.</li>
            </ul>
